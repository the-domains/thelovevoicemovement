  Vocal training is just like any other exercise... it takes hard work to
  achieve results. I don't, can't and won't offer you a magic pill to get to the
  place you want to be with your instrument.  Your voice is produced by the
  combined work between muscles, cartilages, and air in your body. We need to
  train and strengthen those muscles to get your voice in shape. That's when
  "magic" starts to happen. That's when you will feel a difference in your
  voice, and we can start building the road to your vocal freedom.   ​ I had
  been singing for about 12 years before I was introduced to this Vocal
  Technique, Freedom Of Natural Voice Production.  And I feel so fortunate and
  blessed to have closely studied with my Mentor, Kevyn Lettau.  I was so lucky
  to have had years of intense training with her, learning about my voice and
  other people's voices. ​ I believe every singer should have vocal technique,
  no matter how skilled you are as an artist. Your voice is your instrument, and
  it is important to understand it, learn to respect it, develop it, and help it
  when it is in trouble. Many singers go through their careers doing what they
  love, and they do it well.  Unfortunately, there can be so many different
  circumstances that can get in the way of their vocal freedom, causing injury
  and damage to their voice.... long gigs, touring, wrong keys, medical reasons,
  etc....  Having the right technique, and knowing technique gives you the power
  to fight a lot of these issues.  ​ I love working with singers with all kinds
  of experience. It is beautiful to see someone that has barely sung discover
  their own voice.  I love seeing experienced singers find out that they can do
  certain things they never thought they were capable of.... just because they
  didn't have the right tools to do so. They also discover their voice in a
  different way. And I love seeing singers recover from vocal issues and
  continue their careers with new tools that make them feel much more empowered
  in what they do. ​ Vocal technique gives you the freedom to use whatever style
  you want to use.  It should never get in the way of your art!  On the
  contrary, it should serve your art and however you want to express it. We have
  to understand that when we are doing technique, we are technicians.  We are
  working, developing, fixing, strengthening, and creating new muscle memory in
  our instrument.  This is how it will get the power and freedom to perform its
  job as well as possible giving voice to our expression, our art. Little by
  little, everything starts to come together.  You will feel how technique is
  there by your side while you are singing, without having to think about it....
  all the work that you put in your lessons and in your practice time pays off
  in performance..... THAT is what I call Magic. THAT is my promise if you make
  YOUR promise to work on your voice.  ​ So, are you ready to start this journey
  of learning to love, heal and strengthen your voice? ​ ​ ​
